### Project Exercise 11: To-Do List App with Event Handling

- **Topic Covered:** JavaScript, DOM
- **Description:** Build a simple to-do list application where users can add new tasks, mark them as complete, and remove tasks. Use JavaScript event listeners to handle interactions such as adding tasks when the user submits input, toggling task completion when clicked, and deleting tasks when a remove button is clicked. Dynamically update the DOM based on user actions to reflect the changes in the to-do list.
- **Skills Covered:** Event listeners, dynamic DOM manipulation, user interaction, and managing UI updates based on actions.
